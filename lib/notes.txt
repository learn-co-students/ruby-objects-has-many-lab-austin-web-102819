Questions:
* How does adding the :artist attribute to the Song class allow the Artist to access Song data?
        * I assume the :artist attribute creates both #artist=(write) and #artist(read) methods. When we call song.artist = self (line 22, artist.rb), 
        "song" is the song object and "artist" is calling the #artist method to read and write the label into the 
        song object. Since we're calling it on an artist object, the self applies to the artist object.
* song.artist =self means:
    * Take this song object
    * set the artist attribute equal to the current Artist object.
